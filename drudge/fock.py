        name_format
            With the same usage as ``format_``, when it is given as a string, it
            will be used to add the new indexed bases into the name archive.

        set_symms
            If automatic symmetries are going to be set for the new matrix
            elements.

        Return
        ------

        The rewritten form of the expression, as well as a list of tensor
